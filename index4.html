    <h1> Pizza </h1>
<p> Pizza is a popular savory dish of Italian origin, consisting of a flat, round base of leavened wheat-based dough topped
with ingredients like tomato sauce and cheese, which is then baked.

The modern pizza as we know it originated in Naples, Italy, in the 18th and 19th centuries. It started as a simple,
affordable meal for the city's working class. The famous Pizza Margherita, with its toppings of tomato, mozzarella,
and basil, was created in 1889 to honor Queen Margherita of Savoy and represented the colors of the Italian flag.

Today, there are countless styles of pizza around the world, including:

Neapolitan: The original style, known for its soft, thin crust and simple toppings.
New York-style: Characterized by large, thin, foldable slices with a chewy crust.
Chicago deep-dish: A thick, pie-like pizza with a high crust, where the cheese is layered on the bottom and the
tomato sauce is on top.</p>
